	<p>A step by step infographic of how to draw a nose. The first step is a circle connected by two slightly curved parallel lines. The second step has two curved lines added to the bottom circle, to create the bottom of the nose. The third step has shading added around the shape. The last shape has additional curved lines added on either side of the circle, to create the nostrils. </p>
