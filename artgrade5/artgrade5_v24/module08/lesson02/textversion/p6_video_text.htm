    <h5>Draw with a Grid </h5>
    <p>When you draw, using a grid is a technique you can use to help you with your proportions.</p>
    <p>Proportion is the size of one part compared to another part. </p>
    <p>For example, when drawing a face, the forehead is always larger than the nose. They are different proportions. </p>
    <p>Let's get proportionate and draw with a grid. </p>
    <p>We’re going to practice drawing a face. </p>
    <p>We’ll use a grid to guide us. </p>
    <p>You can use numbers and letters on the edge of your grid to help you match up your pieces. </p>
    <p>See how this piece of the image matches with this piece of the grid? Using a grid lets you focus on one area at a time. </p>
    <p>What kinds of lines do you see? </p>
    <p>Do you see shape? </p>
    <p>As you draw with the grid, you can go back and look at the image you are drawing and make adjustments. </p>
    <p>As you move along the grid, try to notice whether any lines continue into the next. </p>
    <p>Connect them at the right spot. </p>
    <p>As you work, remember to check your progress as you go. </p>
    <p>Things are moving along great! </p>
    <p>Proportion is tricky, but now you have a tool to break it down. What will you grid next?</p>
