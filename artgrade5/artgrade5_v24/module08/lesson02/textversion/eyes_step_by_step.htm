	<h5>Eyes: Step-by-Step</h5>
	<p>Step-by-step images on how to draw eyes. In the first step the outline of the subject's eyebrow, eye shape, and pupil is drawn. In the second step the cornea of the eye is lightly shaded in. In the third step darker shades are added to the cornea which adds detail, and shading has started around the eye and eyebrow. In the fourth step more shading is added around the eye and eyebrow, the eyebrows are filled in, and eyelashes are drawn onto the eyes. </p>
