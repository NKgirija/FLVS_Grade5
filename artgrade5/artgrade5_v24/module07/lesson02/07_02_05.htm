            <p>This large outdoor sculpture called <em>Blue Head</em> is located in Amsterdam, Europe. Camp represents a Nigerian woman wearing a flowing piece of cloth wrapped around her head. The unique headpiece represents her African heritage.</p>
               <p>She never felt that she was great at traditional painting, so instead chose to paint metal. She creates royal-looking garments for her sculptures, such as this head wrap. Just like Anatsui, she is using a hard, strong material to represent the soft fabric her subject is wearing in this sculpture. Camp often uses repurposed scrap metal to create her artworks.</p>
