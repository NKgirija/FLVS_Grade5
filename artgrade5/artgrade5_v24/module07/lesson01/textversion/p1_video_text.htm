    <h5>Elements of Art: Texture</h5>
    <p>Texture in art is all about feeling.</p>
    <p>Something rough or something smooth makes an artwork more appealing.</p>
    <p>Painted texture on this forest floor gives you something to explore.</p>
    <p>On the branches, there are crunchy leaves, and rough bark covers the trees.</p>
    <p>There’s texture in any art you create, like the hard objects on this plate.</p>
    <p>This painting is actually smooth, but lines and shapes add texture, too.</p>
    <p>The clothes on this mural are not soft at all because they are painted on a rough wall.</p>
    <p>We can touch actual texture because it’s real.</p> 
    <p>How do you think this sculpture would feel?</p>
    <p>Each tile on this sculpture looks smooth to the touch, but run your fingers across — they feel bumpy and rough.</p>
    <p>Implied texture is when something only looks the way it would feel.</p>
    <p>It’s created with lines and techniques — it’s not real.</p>
    <p>The clouds in this painting look fluffy and soft, but they are created with brushstrokes and a technique called impasto.</p>
    <p>These lines are created with strokes straight and smooth.</p>
    <p>Wavy lines create a bumpy texture that moves.</p>
    <p>You can create implied texture with lines or with dots by hatching, crosshatching, and stippling lots!</p>
    <p>Look at this road — not much texture to see.</p>
    <p>Add some stippling, and it looks rough and bumpy.</p>
    <p>You can create texture in your artwork, too, with technique and imagination — it’s all up to you!</p>
