<p><b>Changing Hues</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>Female voice:</b> How does color change? Color is a hue, but there are tints, tones, and shades. Do you know how to change color? Let's give it a go!</p>

<p>Here we have some bright blue paint. Blue is a color, or a hue. There's also white, black, and gray.</p>

<p>A tint is when you add white to a color. A tint is lighter than the original color. (Hand adds white paint to the pure blue.)</p>

<p>A shade is when you add black to a color. A shade is darker than the original color. (Hand adds a bit of black paint to the pure blue.)</p>

<p>A tone is when you add gray to a color. A tone is not as bright as the original color. It's a little dull. (Hand adds a little gray to the pure blue.)</p>

<p>A very bright color has intensity. Some colors are bright, and some are dull. This is called color intensity.</p>

<p>Look at the colors you made. Which one do you think looks brightest? Which one looks the dullest? You've learned all about hue, tint, tone, shade, and intensity. In this example, you use paint, but the same ideas apply to other media, like chalk pastels. Give it a try sometime!</p>
