		<h5>Texture Chart</h5>
		<p>Texture is how an object feels or looks like it would feel. Texture can bring interest to a work of art.</p>
		<p>Actual texture is how something feels. There is a yellow flower, then underneath it says in three-dimensional
			art, texture is the way something feels.</p>
		<p>Implied texture is texture that you can see but cannot touch; a surface that looks like it has texture. There
			are two pink flowers, showing different angles, and one petal. </p>
		<p>Artists use different techniques to create the illusion of texture in two-dimensional art. </p>
		<p>Smooth gray sphere - use even shading and value</p>
		<p>Hairy - overlap lines and wrap them along the contour of the object </p>
		<p>Soft - use even shading and curved lines</p>
		<p>Bumpy - use rounded lines inside and around the edge of an object</p>
		<p>Rough - use a mixture of dots and short lines</p>
		<p>Sharp - use jagged, pointy lines and shapes</p>
